# 3360HW2-Q4
This repo is for HW2 in my Computing System Fundamentals (3360) course with
Dr. Mina Guirguis. Fall 2024.

Description:
Using a pseudo random number generation function (e.g., rand() in C or other equivalent functions in other
languages) that generates uniformly distributed random numbers, generate a workload for a system that is
composed of 1000 processes. You can assume that processes arrive with an average arrival rate of 2 processes
per second that follows a Poisson Distribution and the service time (i.e., requested duration on the CPU)
for each process follows an Exponential distribution with an average service time of 1 second. Your outcome
would be <process ID, arrival time, requested service time>. You can assume that process IDs are as-
signed incrementally when processes arrive and that they start at 1. What is the actual average arrival rate
and average service times that were generated.
